# after a few hours of night run, the query was both stuck in a buffer pool loop, searching for a free block and was out of free disk space (it took 40GB already)
2018-09-23T05:42:51.810687Z 8 [Warning] [MY-011959] [InnoDB] InnoDB: Difficult to find free blocks in the buffer pool (1783073 search iterations)! 1783073 failed attempts to flush a page! Consider increasing the buffer pool size. It is also possible that in your Unix version fsync is very slow, or completely frozen inside the OS kernel. Then upgrading to a newer version of your operating system may help. Look at the number of fsyncs in diagnostic info below. Pending flushes (fsync) log: 0; buffer pool: 0. 731968 OS file reads, 2760323 OS file writes, 23 OS fsyncs. Starting InnoDB Monitor to print further diagnostics to the standard output.
